[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ozmartian/vidcutter-osx.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ozmartian/vidcutter-osx)

This repository hosts VidCutter macOS builds from Travis CI of the latest development changes so some releases may be unstable or not even work at all. Care is taken to ensure latest commits do not break the build but this cannot be guaranteed.

[![Latest Releases](http://tvlinker.ozmartians.com/images/button-latest-release.png)](https://github.com/ozmartian/vidcutter-osx/releases/latest)

Builds are available for download via the releases page where Travis CI deploys new builds. Builds are available per release build version and will not be archived for each and every build, instead the very latest of the noted version is what you get. If a build is known to be broken it should be resolved and replaced with a fixed update within 24 hours.
